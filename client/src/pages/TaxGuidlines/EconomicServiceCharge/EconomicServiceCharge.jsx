                <p>ESC is will be charged in advance at the importation of certain articles by the Customs on the CIF value certified by the Director General of Customs (irrespective of the threshold limit) as follows;
                    <ul>
                        <li>with effect from 01.04.2016, on any article subject to Special Commodity Levy,</li>

                        <li>with effect from 01.04.2017, on motor vehicle</li>
                    </ul>
                    ESC paid in advance to the Customs can be credited against the ESC liability of the same quarter where the date of clearance of the particular consignment falls. However, the balance liability of ESC, if any, should be paid on or before the 20th day of the subsequent month of the quarter ends.

ESC paid in advance and self payment for the period commencing on or after 01.04.2016 can be set off against the Income Tax payable for the relevant year of assessment and excess, if any, can be carried forward to set off against the liability of two subsequent years of assessment.

However, the excess, if any, of the ESC paid until for the period ended with 31.03.2016 can be carried forward to set off against the liability of four subsequent years of assessment.
